# Build stage: full install (Tailwind lives in devDependencies), then compile
# the CSS bundle. scripts/ must exist before npm ci — the postinstall hook runs
# node scripts/postinstall.js, and MSM_SKIP_POSTINSTALL is honored inside that
# file. The bundle is built explicitly after the full source copy.
