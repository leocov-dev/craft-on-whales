# Minecraft Server Manager

A complete, self-hosted control panel for Minecraft servers that run as Docker containers on the
[itzg/docker-minecraft-server](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server) image. It aims to
rival commercial panels (Pterodactyl, Multicraft, AMP) in polish and capability while staying
entirely free and local: multi-server lifecycle, pinned modpacks, a shared deduplicated mod
library, player moderation, crash forensics, backups, schedules, portable server "blueprints",
storage analytics, a live world map, and more, wrapped in a fast, Minecraft-flavored web UI.

**Zero paid services. Everything runs on your machine, and your entire panel is one folder you can
copy to migrate.**

## Features

**Core**

- **Multi-server lifecycle**: create / start / stop / restart / recreate / delete, with graceful
  RCON `stop` before container stop, health-aware status, and crash detection with backoff.
- **Guided wizard**: Simple mode (the common knobs) or Advanced mode exposing every environment
  variable the image supports, each with plain-English help, grouped by section, plus a raw
  `KEY=value` escape hatch. Only non-default values are applied.
- **Modpacks are always pinned**: "latest" is resolved to a concrete version id at install time and
  pinned, so the image never silently upgrades a pack on restart. Upgrades are explicit: preview →
  automatic pre-update backup → graceful stop → re-pin → recreate → health monitoring → **one-click
  rollback** if it doesn't come up.
- **Custom-mod overlay**: mods you add yourself are downloaded into a shared, sha256-deduplicated
  library and hard-linked into the server; they survive pack updates. Disabling is class-aware
  (overlay mods rename to `.disabled`; pack-managed mods use the image's exclusion mechanism).
- **Console, logs & RCON**: live console over WebSocket, ANSI rendering, search/level filters, a
  command bar with history, and a player list with quick actions. Every server gets a generated,
  encrypted RCON password injected automatically.
- **Player moderation**: whitelist, ops (levels 1–4), bans, IP bans; via RCON while running and via
  direct JSON edits while stopped ("applies on start"). Teleport by coordinates, to a player, or to
  the nearest biome.
- **Backups & schedules**: save-safe archive/restore with retention classes and free-space
  preflight; per-server and global cron tasks (restart / backup / RCON) with next-run previews.
- **Blueprints (`.mcserver.zip`)**: a portable recipe of an instance. Full config (secrets
  stripped), resource limits, the pinned pack reference, the custom-mod overlay manifest (source
  URLs + hashes), chosen config files, and optionally an embedded world. Import reproduces the same
  server with fresh ports and per-mod hash-verified downloads. Clone = export + import.
- **Storage analytics & quotas**: a background size-indexer walks `./data`, caches sizes, and
  panel-enforces per-server disk quotas (Docker can't cap bind-mount usage); usage breakdowns,
  largest-files, orphan detection, and trend charts.
- **History & crash reports**: every action (lifecycle, config diffs, mods, packs, backups, RCON,
  player actions, schedules) is a structured event with actor and captured log excerpts. Crash
  reports are auto-detected, parsed (exception + suspected mods), and exportable.
- **Accounts & two-factor auth**: multi-user with **admin / operator / viewer** roles, plus optional
  **two-factor authentication (TOTP)** for any account. Enroll with any authenticator app (Google
  Authenticator, Authy, 1Password, …), keep one-time backup codes, and reset a locked-out user as an
  admin. See the [2FA guide](docs/two-factor-authentication.md).

**Beyond the basics** (all shipped, all self-hosted)

- **Live world map**: one click installs BlueMap matched to the server's loader, allocates a port,
  and embeds it in a tab served only through the panel's authenticated proxy.
- **Analytics & scoreboard**: vanilla stats ingested on a schedule (playtime, deaths, kills,
  blocks/diamonds mined, distance), per-player profiles, and a rankable scoreboard.
- **Activity timeline**: every log line classified (chat, joins, leaves, deaths incl. PvP,
  advancements) into a searchable per-server timeline. Chat is captured locally only.
- **Inventory forensics**: read any player's inventory/armor/ender chest from playerdata NBT,
  automatic snapshots on join/death, side-by-side snapshot diffs, cross-player item search,
  give/clear via RCON.
- **Investigation**: advisory x-ray suspicion scoring from ore-discovery ratios vs the server
  median; evidence laid out, never auto-punishing.
- **Discord**: webhook notifications (lifecycle, crashes, backups, updates, player actions) with
  per-event toggles; URLs stored encrypted.
- **Invites & client modpacks**: a paste-ready invite block plus a generated client `.mrpack` with
  the server pre-added to the in-game server list.
- **Pick-mods-first solver**: choose the mods you want; the solver intersects Modrinth metadata to
  propose the newest fully-compatible loader + MC version pair and installs the set on creation.
- **Public status page**: optional unauthenticated `/status/<slug>` per server (name, version,
  player count only).

## Why this over Pterodactyl, Crafty Controller, or AMP?

All three are capable general game panels. This one is **purpose-built for Minecraft on the
[itzg/docker-minecraft-server](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server) image**, so the parts
that are fiddly elsewhere are first-class here:

- **vs [Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/)**: no separate Wings daemon, database server, or "egg"
  setup to run; it's one Node process talking to your Docker socket. Minecraft-specific features
  (pinned modpacks, a shared deduplicated mod library, crash forensics, portable blueprints) are built
  in, not community add-ons.
- **vs [Crafty Controller](https://craftycontrol.com/)**: same free, self-hosted spirit, but every
  server is a clean, resource-capped **Docker container** rather than a bare process, with per-server
  disk quotas, a one-click live map, and portable `.mcserver.zip` blueprints.
- **vs [AMP](https://cubecoders.com/AMP)**: no per-machine licence and no paid tiers. **MIT-licensed
  and free**, with the itzg image's entire environment-variable surface exposed and explained in plain
  English.

## Requirements

- **Node.js 24+** (current LTS): uses the built-in `node:sqlite` (flagless from Node 24), so there are
  **no native modules to compile**. The panel prints a clear message and exits if run on an older Node.
- **Docker**
  - **Windows:** Docker Desktop (WSL2 backend). The panel talks to `\\.\pipe\docker_engine`.
  - **macOS:** Docker Desktop (`/var/run/docker.sock`).
  - **Linux:** Docker Engine (`/var/run/docker.sock`; add your user to the `docker` group).
- A few GB of disk for server images + worlds.

The panel and the Docker daemon are expected to run on the **same host** (server data is bind-mounted
by host path).

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leocov-dev/craft-on-whales.git craft-on-whales
cd craft-on-whales
npm install               # installs deps and builds the Tailwind CSS (postinstall)
cp .env.example .env      # optional — all values have sane defaults
npm start                 # or: npm run dev (auto-restart + CSS watch)
```

Open **http://localhost:25564**. By default the panel binds to **localhost only** (`127.0.0.1`), so it's
reachable just from this machine; set `PANEL_HOST=0.0.0.0` to reach it across your LAN. The **first run**
walks you through a system check, choosing your time zone, and creating the admin account. If Docker
isn't running you still get the full UI, and the lifecycle features light up when the daemon comes up.

You do **not** need to set anything in `.env` to start: on first run the panel generates a strong
random secret and persists it under your data directory (`data/.session-secret`). Set `SESSION_SECRET`
yourself only if you want to control it (e.g. to share one across replicas).

### Run the panel itself in Docker

A pre-built multi-arch image (amd64 + arm64) is published to GHCR on every release:
`ghcr.io/leocov-dev/craft-on-whales:latest` (or pin a version tag, e.g. `:v0.9.0`).
Grab the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) from the repo root, set **one** variable, and start:

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/msm/data
echo "DATA_DIR_HOST=/opt/msm/data" > .env   # ABSOLUTE host path for all panel data
docker compose up -d
```

Open **http://your-host:25564**. In Portainer/Dockge, paste the compose file as a stack and set
`DATA_DIR_HOST` in the stack's environment.

How it works — and what to know:

- The panel drives the **host's Docker daemon** through the mounted `/var/run/docker.sock` and creates
  each Minecraft server as a **sibling container** (not a child). Game ports are published by those
  containers directly on the host, so the panel container itself only exposes the web UI port.
- `DATA_DIR_HOST` is required and must be the **absolute host path** of the directory mounted at
  `/data`: bind mounts are resolved by the daemon against the **host** filesystem, so the panel
  re-roots every path it hands to Docker from its container-local view onto that host path. Without
  it the daemon would mount host directories that don't exist.
- The container binds to `0.0.0.0` **inside its own network namespace**; publish `127.0.0.1:25564:25564`
  instead of `25564:25564` if a reverse proxy on the host fronts the panel (then set `TRUST_PROXY` +
  `COOKIE_SECURE`).
- Anything that holds the Docker socket is root-equivalent on the host — treat the panel's admin
  login accordingly and never expose the UI raw to the internet.
- Docker Desktop (Windows/macOS) is not a target for this mode — run the panel natively there;
  containerized deployment is aimed at Linux hosts (Portainer, Dockge, plain compose).
- Features that reach a **sibling** container directly — currently just the live map (BlueMap) —
  try, in order: every Docker-network IP the sibling container has (its own container port, no
  host-port involved), then the sibling's HOST-published port via `host.docker.internal` (not
  `127.0.0.1` — that's the panel's own loopback, not the host's). Whichever answers first is
  cached. The bundled `docker-compose.yml` maps `host.docker.internal` via `extra_hosts:
host.docker.internal:host-gateway` (Docker Engine 20.10+) for the fallback path; a raw
  `docker run` or a stack tool that doesn't read `extra_hosts` from the compose file needs the
  equivalent `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway` flag, or set `MAP_PROXY_HOST`
  yourself.
- **Reverse-proxy setups (Pangolin, NGINX, Traefik…) where a server's Docker network is set**
  (Advanced Docker Settings) for the reverse proxy to reach it directly: put the **panel**
  container on that same network too (add a `networks:` block to the panel service in
  `docker-compose.yml`, referencing it as `external: true`) so the direct container-IP path above
  actually has a route — without that, the panel falls back to the host-published-port path,
  which may not be reachable at all in a network topology built around bypassing host ports.

> **Exposure:** the panel binds to localhost by default. Set `PANEL_HOST=0.0.0.0` for LAN access, and only
> put it on the internet behind a reverse proxy with TLS (set `TRUST_PROXY` + `COOKIE_SECURE`). Auth is
> mandatory from the first run.

> **Time zone & region:** picked during first-run setup (auto-detected from your system) and changeable
> in Settings. All dates and player-activity times display in the zone you choose.

### Windows notes

- Docker Desktop must be running before you start/create servers.
- Share your project drive with Docker Desktop (Settings → Resources → File sharing) so bind mounts
  work. The panel's Docker status endpoint tells you if the daemon is unreachable.
- Bind mounts on Docker Desktop are slower than named volumes; the panel uses bind mounts anyway
  because _portability wins_: your entire panel is one folder.

## Networking, ports & remote access

A fresh install is **localhost-only**: it answers only at `http://localhost:25564` on the machine
it runs on. This section covers how to reach it from elsewhere and exactly which ports to open.

### Ports at a glance

| What                     | Port(s)                                      | Protocol  | Open to the internet?                     |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Admin panel (web UI)** | `PANEL_PORT` — default **25564**             | TCP       | Only behind TLS (reverse proxy), not raw  |
| **Game server (Java)**   | from `PORT_GAME_START` (**25565**) upward    | TCP + UDP | **Yes** — this is how players connect     |
| **RCON**                 | game port **+ 1000** (from **26565**)        | TCP       | **No — never.** Panel-internal management |
| **Bedrock / Geyser**     | from `PORT_BEDROCK_START` (**19132**) upward | UDP       | Only if you run Bedrock                   |
| **Live map (BlueMap)**   | auto-allocated                               | TCP       | **No** — served through the panel's proxy |

The panel itself sits at **25564**, one below the game runway, so game instances count cleanly
upward from 25565 with nothing interrupting the sequence. Game ports are then assigned **first-free**,
one game + RCON pair per server. Ten servers therefore occupy game `25565–25574` (TCP+UDP), RCON
`26565–26574` (TCP), and, where Bedrock is enabled, `19132+` (UDP). The 1000-port RCON offset is
deliberate: it keeps RCON in a separate block so you can open a contiguous **game** range without ever
exposing RCON.

> **Why RCON must stay closed:** RCON is a plaintext remote-admin protocol guarded only by a password.
> The panel reaches it via `docker exec` _inside_ the container, so the host RCON port is never needed
> from outside. Leave `26565+` blocked at the firewall.

### Reach the panel from another machine

The panel binds to `127.0.0.1` out of the box. To listen on all interfaces, set in `.env`:

```env
PANEL_HOST=0.0.0.0
PANEL_PORT=25564
```

Restart the panel so it re-reads the environment. **Under PM2 you must pass `--update-env`**, or
PM2 keeps the old value:

```bash
pm2 restart <id> --update-env      # PM2 — --update-env is essential
# or restart however you launched it
```

Confirm the bind address actually changed:

```bash
ss -tlnp | grep 25564              # want 0.0.0.0:25564, not 127.0.0.1:25564
```

Then open the panel port in **both** the host firewall and, on a VPS, your provider's separate
cloud firewall (the one people forget):

```bash
sudo ufw allow 25564/tcp                                                            # ufw
# sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=25564/tcp --permanent && sudo firewall-cmd --reload  # firewalld
```

### Open game ports for players

Open a range sized to how many servers you plan to run. Game ports are **TCP and UDP**: UDP carries
the query protocol on the same port.

```bash
sudo ufw allow 25565:25584/tcp
sudo ufw allow 25565:25584/udp
sudo ufw allow 19132:19141/udp     # Bedrock / Geyser — only if used
```

Do **not** add a rule for the RCON range (`26565+`).

### Do it safely (recommended)

Exposing the raw panel port on the internet means logins travel over **plain HTTP**. Prefer one of:

- **Reverse proxy with TLS**: keep `PANEL_HOST=127.0.0.1`, terminate HTTPS in front, and set
  `TRUST_PROXY=1` + `COOKIE_SECURE=auto`. Minimal [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/):

  ```
  mc.example.com {
      reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:25564
  }
  ```

  You then open only `80`/`443`, never `25564`.

- **SSH tunnel**: no exposure, no firewall change, just for you:

  ```bash
  ssh -L 25564:127.0.0.1:25564 user@your-server     # then open http://localhost:25564 locally
  ```

### Running under a process manager (PM2 / systemd)

The panel requires **Node.js 24+** (built-in `node:sqlite`). Gotcha with **PM2**: it launches apps
with whatever Node version started the PM2 _daemon_, and later switching your shell with `nvm` does
**not** change it. A restart can silently re-launch on the old version and fail the Node-24 preflight.
Pin the interpreter per app:

```bash
pm2 start src/server.js --name craft-on-whales --interpreter "$(nvm which 24)"
pm2 save
```

(or `pm2 kill && pm2 resurrect` to relaunch the whole daemon under your current default Node.)

## The `./data` directory — everything lives here

```
data/
  .session-secret        auto-generated panel secret (keep private; delete = rotate)
  panel.db               SQLite database (node:sqlite, WAL)
  servers/<id>/          bind-mounted as /data into each container (world, mods, configs…)
  backups/<id>/          backup archives
  blueprints/            .mcserver.zip exports
  library/mods/          shared mod/plugin jars, deduplicated by sha256
  library/modpacks/      pack archives
  library/worlds/        world archives (the world library)
  library/icons/         instance icons + cached mod icons
  logs/<id>/events/      captured log excerpts linked from history events
  tmp/                   in-flight downloads (wiped on boot)
```

**Copy `data/` to another machine → you migrated the whole panel.** Back it up like you'd back up a
world. Every file operation is contained to this root (path-guard enforced).

## How the important things work

### Two memory limits

- **Java heap** (`MEMORY`): what Minecraft may use.
- **Container limit** (Docker `HostConfig.Memory`): the hard cap; hitting it OOM-kills the server.

Keep the container limit 25–50% above the heap. The wizard does this automatically; the Settings
form validates it.

### Java version selection

The image does **not** pick Java for you. The panel maps MC version → image tag
(`java8/16/17/21/25/latest`) with a per-server override in Advanced settings.

### GT New Horizons

GTNH is installed from its own release index rather than CurseForge, and the panel always pins an
exact pack version. Java is chosen per version from the index's own `maxJavaVersion`: GTNH 2.8.0 and
later run on **Java 25** via the pack's bundled lwjgl3ify patches, older releases on Java 21 or 17.
Budget **6 GB of heap and 20 GB of disk** to start — the wizard raises both for you. See the
[modpacks guide](docs/modpacks.md) for the full pack workflow.

### Disk quotas are panel-enforced

Docker can't cap bind-mount disk usage, so a background size-indexer walks `./data`, caches sizes in
SQLite, and blocks disk-growing operations (mod installs, backups, world uploads) for servers over
quota. Optional strict mode gracefully stops a runaway server past its quota.

### Secrets at rest

API keys and RCON passwords are encrypted with AES-256-GCM, using a key derived from `SESSION_SECRET`.
Blueprints never contain secrets. The panel refuses to set footgun env vars (`REMOVE_OLD_MODS`,
`LOAD_ENV_FROM_*`).

### Password recovery

There is no self-service password reset (the panel has no email/SMTP dependency by design). If you're
locked out, stop the panel and reset the admin password with the maintenance script:

```bash
node scripts/reset-password.js <username>
```

---

## Security

- **Localhost-only by default**: binds `127.0.0.1` out of the box; LAN/internet exposure is an explicit opt-in.
- Session auth (SQLite-backed), bcrypt password hashes, login rate-limiting, first-run admin setup.
- **Two-factor authentication (TOTP)**: opt-in per account (any role), with one-time backup codes and an
  admin reset path; the login rate-limit is shared across the password and code steps so a correct
  password can't reset the counter before code-guessing.
- Roles: **admin / operator / viewer**, enforced on every mutating request (user management in Settings).
- `SameSite=Strict` cookies + Origin checks on all state-changing requests; WebSockets authenticate
  the session cookie on upgrade. Security headers (CSP, `X-Frame-Options`, `nosniff`) on every response.
- Secrets encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM), and never readable through the file manager. Blueprints strip
  secrets on export.
- Every file path is validated against escape from `./data` (including symlinks that resolve outside it);
  archive extraction is zip-slip-guarded and size-capped. Server-side downloads (mods, icons) are
  SSRF-guarded against private/internal addresses. The BlueMap proxy never forwards your session cookie
  to the map container.

## Architecture

The layering rule: **routes (HTTP) → services (domain logic) → docker/db/storage (infrastructure).**

## Status & areas that need work

This is an early public release. The core lifecycle is solid, but several features are
deliberately "good enough for now": honest contribution targets rather than finished work. If you
want to help, start here.

- **Custom RTP (random teleport)**: the panel's own random-teleport picks a point in a ring around
  the player and lands them on the highest solid block via `spreadplayers`. It retries a few times to
  dodge ocean/void, but there's **no real safety scan**; you can still land on tree canopy, a cave
  roof, or an exposed cliff. It's **online-only**, runs **one search at a time per server** (a
  `/locate`/`spreadplayers` sweep briefly stalls the server's main thread), seeds distance from the
  player's **last-saved** position (can be stale), and its point distribution clusters toward the
  centre rather than being area-uniform.

- **Structure finding**: nearest-structure teleport uses a bundled vanilla list plus a best-effort
  scan of the server's structure tags for modded content. Each structure's home dimension is a static
  lookup that **defaults to the Overworld**, so a modded structure that only generates elsewhere can
  fail to locate. "Surprise me" just searches from a random ring point, not a genuinely random
  structure. Online-only, same main-thread stall.

- **Biome finding**: modded biomes are only discovered on **Forge/NeoForge** (via their registry-tag
  commands). On Fabric/Quilt/Paper the picker falls back to the bundled **vanilla** biome list, so
  modded biomes won't appear, and cross-dimension biome mapping is partly heuristic.

- **Giving / taking items**: give and clear go over RCON and are **online-only**. `give` hands over a
  **plain stack, with no enchantments, custom NBT/components, names, or contents** (you can't give an
  enchanted or renamed item from the UI yet). Per-slot god-mode editing _can_ preserve component data
  offline (direct `.dat` rewrite), but a **live count change resets custom components**, and offline
  edits are refused while the player is online.

- **Item listing**: the JEI-style registry is built offline from each server's own jar lang files, so
  it works for any loader/pack, but it's **`en_us` only**, covers only `item.*`/`block.*` names, and so
  **misses datapack-added items, entities, and anything without a lang entry**. It's names + ids only,
  with **no icons/textures, NBT variants, or recipes** (not a full JEI). Listing and giving aren't fully
  wired together: you can find an item but only give its plain form.

- **Live map (BlueMap)**: one-click install works, but it only takes effect on the **next restart**,
  only manages `accept-download: true` (no in-panel render/marker/storage config), supports a **fixed
  set of server types**, and the map's web server is bound on all host interfaces. Reach it **only**
  through the panel's authenticated proxy and **don't open that port in your firewall** (binding it
  loopback-only is on the list).

- **General**: much of the god-mode surface is **online/RCON-first** with thinner offline paths;
  several version-specific assumptions (1.20.5 item components, 1.21.5 `equipment` layout) are
  confirmed only against a handful of versions and may drift; and there's no automated end-to-end
  coverage of these live-server flows yet beyond the manual `npm run test:smoke` sweep.
