# Modpacks

[← Back to docs index](README.md)

The **Modpacks** page (and the **From modpack** tab in the [creation wizard](servers.md)) installs a modpack as a server, always **pinned to an exact pack version** so a restart can never silently upgrade the pack out from under you.

## Supported platforms

- **Packwiz** — paste a `pack.toml` URL (the format packwiz authors publish). Packwiz packs aren't
  searchable, so this is a direct-URL install only. The pack URL is shown on the server's Overview
  tab, and its Mods tab becomes a read-only list parsed from the pack rather than the editable mod
  overlay other install methods get — see [Worlds & files](worlds-and-files.md#mods).
- **CurseForge** — search or paste a pack URL. Needs a CurseForge API key for search and private packs (add it under Settings → API keys).
- **Modrinth** — search by name.
- **FTB** — Feed The Beast packs.
- **GT New Horizons** — the 1.7.10 expert pack, installed from GTNH's own release index. GTNH picks its Java runtime per pack version (2.8.0+ runs on **Java 25** via bundled lwjgl3ify patches, older releases on Java 21 or 17), and the wizard raises the server's RAM and disk to sensible minimums for it.

## How pinning works

When you pick a pack, the panel resolves the exact version, records it, and installs that. On the **Updates** page you'll be told when a newer version is available; upgrading is a deliberate, guarded action with a pre-update backup and rollback — never automatic. Stable-tracking servers are never offered a beta.

## Upgrading a pack

From a pinned server you can upgrade to a newer version in one action. The panel takes a backup first, swaps the pinned version, recreates the container (re-resolving Java if the new version needs a different runtime), and monitors the first boot — with a generous window for large packs like GTNH that download a couple of gigabytes and build a several-hundred-mod world on first start.
